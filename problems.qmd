title: "Problems I'm Exploring"
---

As a product manager, I'm driven by real problems that affect people's lives. Here are the challenges I'm currently thinking about and why they matter to me.

## 1. Time Drought

**The Problem:** There never seems to be enough time to do everything life demands — or everything we want to do. Between work, school, relationships, and personal growth, time has become one of the scarcest resources in modern life.

**Why It Matters to Me:** I constantly feel the tension between responsibilities and the goals that energize me. If I could better design how I use my time, I could invest more in the activities and people that matter most. I'm drawn to solutions that help people be intentional with their time instead of feeling controlled by it.

## 2. Digital Overload

**The Problem:** We live in a state of constant digital stimulation. Notifications, messages, and endless content compete for attention, making it difficult to focus deeply or truly disconnect from devices.

**Why It Matters to Me:** I experience this daily across my phone, computer, and watch. It's easy to lose time and attention without realizing it. Reducing digital noise would not only improve my productivity at work and school, but also help me be more present in my relationships and everyday life.

## 3. Housing Affordability in Utah

**The Problem:** Housing prices have risen dramatically, putting homeownership — even starter homes — out of reach for many first-time buyers.

**Why It Matters to Me:** As my husband and I plan for life after college, owning a home feels increasingly distant. This isn't just a market trend; it's a life milestone that now requires years of additional saving and uncertainty. I'm interested in solutions that make housing more accessible and financially realistic for young families.

## 4. Motivation Without Direction

**The Problem:** Many people want to improve their lives but don't know where to begin or what path will actually move them forward. The gap between desire and direction keeps people stuck.

**Why It Matters to Me:** I've been in that place — wanting growth but lacking clarity. With guidance and support, I was able to make meaningful changes and dramatically improve my quality of life. Now, I notice how common this struggle is, and I'm motivated to help others find clear, achievable starting points for their own progress.

## 5. The Culture of Constant Comparison

**The Problem:** Social media, filtered realities, and growing pressures around appearance and success have intensified comparison culture. People are constantly measuring themselves against unrealistic standards of beauty, achievement, and happiness.

**Why It Matters to Me:** I've felt the mental toll of constant comparison strongly enough to step away from social media altogether. I also see how new appearance-focused trends and treatments can amplify insecurities rather than solve them. I care deeply about building environments — digital and otherwise — that support confidence, authenticity, and well-being instead of fueling comparison.
