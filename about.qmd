## Background

I'm a strategic business student driven by a passion for solving meaningful problems. My education has shaped the way I approach challenges — balancing big-picture thinking with practical execution, and always focusing on creating real value for users and organizations.

I'm especially drawn to work at the intersection of strategy, technology, and customer experience. I enjoy turning ambiguous problems into clear, actionable solutions and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life.

That's what led me to product management. I'm excited by the opportunity to build innovative software products that scale, evolve, and make a positive impact. More than anything, I'm motivated by building with purpose — creating thoughtful solutions that genuinely improve how people work and live.
